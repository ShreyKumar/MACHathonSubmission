# MACHathon Submission

## Quick start
1. Clone this repo
2. Install all dependencies with `yarn`
3. Start the app with `yarn start`
4. A window should now pop up with a QR code
5. Install the Expo Go app for iOS and Android
6. Scan the QR code using your camera, this should allow you to emulate development on your phone in realtime

## Troubleshooting
If at any time, the hot reload doesn't work, you can simply press `r` in your terminal to rebuild the app on your phone
